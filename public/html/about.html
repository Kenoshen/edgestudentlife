				<p>
					My name is Brittany Wingfield.  I am 23 years old and have been married for 3 years to my high school sweetheart. I am currently striving towards my Masters in Clinical Mental Health Counseling.  I have a great passion for people and have also felt led to and love working with teens.  It is a tough world that our teens face and my goal is to encourage them and show them love in the best way that I can.  I want to be a listening ear when the kids need it and give them support in whatever way possible.  In my youth group days, I looked up to and cherished the relationships that I had with my youth sponsors. I will always hold those relationships dear and hope to have the same impact on someone’s life that my youth sponsors had on me. In my free time I enjoy being with my family and friends, as well as being active.  I love living in Colorado and am privileged to get to explore what my beautiful state has to offer.  I love being outdoors doing such activities as camping, hiking and snowboarding.
