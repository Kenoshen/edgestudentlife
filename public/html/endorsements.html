		<p>
			I am confident that EDGE Outreach and Chris Phelps have made lasting impacts on the lives of students everywhere.  As a teacher at the school Chris has brought EDGE to, and as a lifelong friend of Chris, I ask you to consider investing in this remarkable student outreach program.
		</p>
		<p>
			I grew up with Chris and his wife Christie, as we both attended Gateway Christian Church in Aurora, CO as kids and young adults. I have witnessed first-hand the organic relationships Chris has built over the years with the youth in our community, meeting them where they are at and loving them unconditionally. As an adult, I began to teach at ThunderRidge High School in Highlands Ranch, CO three years ago. My path crossed with Chris’ again when he came to me asking to bring EDGE to ThunderRidge. Immediately I knew this would be so beneficial to my students because I know what kind of person Chris is. After logistics were worked out, Chris began meeting kids at ThunderRidge on Thursdays during the lunch period, and immediately I noticed a difference. Kids who maybe didn’t fit in before then had a place to go and hang out during lunch. I have had students who would count down the days to Thursday each week because they knew it meant Chris would be there for lunch. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I’ve also witnessed what EDGE does on Thursday nights, at least when my schedule allows it. Chris has provided a place for high school students to congregate and build relationships with one another, and the way in which Chris does this could not be more genuine. Chris is someone who truly understands what it means to form lasting relationships. He takes every opportunity to love kids and get them connected with other peers.  
		</p>
		<p>
			I ask you to please consider investing in EDGE. I have witnessed first hand what it has done to my students and to the youth of the community I work in. Chris Phelps is the definition of sincerity & compassion, so I only ask that you have faith in what he is doing so he can continue to better the lives of the youth in my community.

			Sincerely,
		</p>

		</p>
		<p>
			I am confident that the EDGE program has made a positive impact on ThunderRidge High School. For
			the past two and a half years Chris Phelps has been visiting ThunderRidge once a week. His first year
			of the EDGE program, Chris brought in pizzas to lunch during his visits students really responded to
			this and he made lasting connections with many students. Chris has made a strong connection with a
			variety of students, he knows some students that are involved in youth group activities, but EDGE has
			given him the opportunity to expand his connections to a different group of kids. Chris has made
			connections with students from all different groups, first by offering them free food and second by
			being an outstanding role model.
		</p>
		<p>
			Chris has an infectious personality. His spirit and charisma are incredible and they allow him to
			connect with so many students, some of which don’t make new meaningful connections very often.
			Chris’ says that his main goal is to be a positive influence on kids’ lives and he has made a lasting
			impact on so many of the young people at ThunderRidge. This year Chris started bringing in a
			popcorn machine; the number of students I see with popcorn on Thursdays is astonishing. Chris
			continues think of innovative ways to connect with kids, and his ability to just be available for students
			who might not feel like they have someone to talk to has changed the atmosphere at ThunderRidge for
			the better.

			There are multiple organizations that seek to make a difference in the lives of teenagers today.  Whether it be through service projects or relational experiences or some other impactful activity, there is certainly no shortage of opportunities for corporations and individuals to invest in the future, both physically and financially.  As an educator, coach and parent, I see on a daily basis the fruit of many of these organizations and feel compelled to offer an endorsement of one with which I have had multiple interactions – EDGE Outreach.  
		</p>
		<p>
			As a teacher and coach for the past 26 years, I recognize the struggles and challenges that teenagers deal with and am very grateful for organizations that try to reach kids ‘where they are’ and encourage them with a message of hope and a sense of purpose.  EDGE Outreach is one such organization.  With weekly meetings and activities throughout the year that reach out to young people in a manner that is not only appealing, but also consistent with the principles of the Christian faith, this organization is a relevant and vibrant group that most certainly changes kids’ lives.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a parent to five children, finding organizations that will come along side what we are teaching our children and even challenge them to grow in a very personal way is foremost in our decision making.  Our two oldest daughters attended a camp this summer that was affordable due to outside support provided to EDGE, but was more importantly hugely impactful to them personally.  They came home more intent on managing their own personal spiritual growth and our oldest daughter even feels like she found her calling as a teacher in early childhood education.  God may refine her focus as she grows, but the EDGE Camp helped to point her into a faith-based career that she may not have discovered otherwise.  
		</p>
		<p>
			As I said before, there are numerous ways to invest in the future, but supporting EDGE Outreach is a tremendous way to impact eternity.  I would absolutely encourage you to consider how you can partner with EDGE Outreach and be a difference maker in the lives of the future.
